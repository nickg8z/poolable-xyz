  <div class="text-center mb-16">
    <h2 class="font-retro text-4xl md:text-5xl text-primary mb-6">Our Why</h2>
    <p class="font-comp text-xl text-primary-light max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      In a space often dominated by short-term thinking and value extraction, Poolable emerged from a different vision—one that harks back to the original promise of web3.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-12 mb-20">
    <div class="bg-primary-dark p-8 rounded-lg">
      <h3 class="font-retro text-2xl text-primary mb-4">Born from Experience</h3>
      <p class="font-comp text-lg text-primary-light">
        Our founder's journey with his previous project revealed a crucial gap in the web3 ecosystem: the absence of a trusted space where builders could connect without the constant pressure of monetization and markup. We saw firsthand how difficult it was to find genuine partnerships amidst a sea of solicitations, and how many opportunities for collaboration were being missed simply because the right connections weren't being made.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="bg-primary-dark p-8 rounded-lg">
      <h3 class="font-retro text-2xl text-primary mb-4">Beyond Networking</h3>
      <p class="font-comp text-lg text-primary-light">
        Poolable isn't just another business network—we're opportunity architects guided by a powerful conviction: that web3's greatest innovations will come from unexpected collaborations and genuine partnerships. Just as the early crypto community united around Bitcoin's vision of financial freedom, we exist to unite today's builders around the shared goal of making web3's idealistic vision a reality.
      </p>
    </div>

  <div class="bg-primary-dark p-8 rounded-lg mb-20">
    <h3 class="font-retro text-2xl text-primary mb-4">Our Commitment</h3>
    <p class="font-comp text-lg text-primary-light">
      We're starting with a radical premise: that the most valuable connections shouldn't come with a price tag. That's why Poolable operates on a zero-cost model, sustained by the generosity and mutual value creation of our community. We believe that by removing financial barriers and focusing on trust, we can create the kind of collaborative ecosystem that web3 has always promised to be.
    </p>

  <div class="bg-primary-dark p-8 rounded-lg mb-20">
    <h3 class="font-retro text-2xl text-primary mb-4">Looking Forward</h3>
    <p class="font-comp text-lg text-primary-light">
      Every connection we facilitate, every partnership we inspire, and every collaboration we enable brings us one step closer to our vision of a more equitable and decentralized future. Whether you're building a groundbreaking protocol, launching an innovative NFT project, or developing new web3 infrastructure, you're not just joining a network—you're becoming part of a movement to reshape how value is created and shared in the digital age.
